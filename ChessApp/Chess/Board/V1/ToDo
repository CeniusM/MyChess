Get all the pawns to move

Test that the King, Knight, and Pawns work completly as intendead

Go around and clean up

then add rooks/bishop/queen

when it all works:
optimitation ideers:
-try and make a branch where all the multi dimensinel arrays get cut down to a single array
 try and speed test the 2, cause my theory is that all the derefrencing and bounce checking
 makes it slower then having a sinle array and just use multiplication the get the right index
