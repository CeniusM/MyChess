Make it so the Knight and King moves dosent give the + or - value but just the pos for the next move
so fx a value for the kin could be {-1,-7,-8,-9,1,7,8,9} but instead give the square for the position
so like if at 10 {9,3,4,5,11,17,18,19}


Make your own List<Move>/stack code







Use stockfish to find the invald moves


position fen r3k2r/p1ppqpb1/bn2pnp1/3PN3/1p2P3/2N2Q1p/PPPBBPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 0
d
go perft 5



Check:
Better code for checking the king and what happends when the king is in check

testing:
make a regit full test of everything
make it time how long the search function takes

board logic:
add magic bitboards
clean up

evalutation:
add it so the peiece value also depends on the placment

ai / search funtion:
add MinMax
add that like long where you can see if the game has been played


Add Multithreading to the move combinations code
make it so you have as many threads as cores and you set the first thread to start the other threads and then begin it self
so when one thread reaches the depth it will begin on the next unused move and when there arent any left it just stops







1.
Make the board work

2.
make unitests

3.
make some timing code for testing speed

4.
make the search functions

beat a human <3






















1.
lav Pieceplacements into an array, then alicate like 0-1 for the kings so the for loop in the kings only need to check those
also do that with like the rooks, where it checks idk, like 4-5 of the array in the for loop, and like 15-31 for Pawns
just not sure how the promoted peices would work

4.5.
make the castle work
and make the code for if the kings is in check
implement the poseblemoves

3.
remake the player ui

4.75.
as soon as the chess code compitly works, make an evaluation method that estimates, look to video for insperation

4.875
make a method that just runs the all the difrent moves in a serten amount of depth

5.
implement the heighliheting of posblemoves from the seleckted piece, 
and make the squares you just moved light up
and a bar where you can see the evaluation

6.
make a random ai

7.
Make the code faaaast, just come with ideers
remake the piece movement code
make it so the game remebers where the pieces are instead of looping over all of them
just look at sebastians code... :d

8.
maby use copute shader to do the bitmap stuff. or just a seperate lone thread

9.
make the ui even better

10.
Make an AI/algorithm

11.
make, it, faaaast, with copute shader or multi threading

12.
Compute shader ? https://www.ddl.unimi.it/manual/plugins/c-scripts.htm









as soon this procjekt is done, make it in c++ for reals <3
